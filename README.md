# 🎬 Scenes From Data Science

Welcome to a curated collection of Python experiments — each one a scene in the unfolding drama of data, logic, and creativity. This repository documents foundational lab work from F.Y. B.Tech (ECO), reimagined as narrative-driven explorations in web crawling, machine learning, and data visualization.

## 🧠 Concept

This isn’t just a lab manual. It’s a portfolio of transformation — where simple code becomes story, and every experiment is a character in your technical evolution.

## 🎭 Experiments

| Scene | Title | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **04** | 🕷️ *The Hunter* | Web crawling using BeautifulSoup, Requests, and lxml — a digital predator unleashed. |
| **05** | ⚡ *The Spark* | TensorFlow multiplication of constants — the ignition of machine learning. |
| **06** | 🧠 *The Awakening* | TensorFlow sessions and graphs — where computation comes alive. |
| **07** | 🎨 *The Artist* | Seaborn visualizations — painting data with elegance and precision. |
| **08** | 🪄 *The Illusionist* | Bokeh interactive plots — turning raw data into visual magic.

Each experiment lives in its own folder, complete with code, theory, and a README that dramatizes its purpose.

## 🧰 Requirements

To run the experiments, install the following packages:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests lxml tensorflow seaborn bokeh
